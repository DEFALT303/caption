## ‚ö°Ô∏è Contribute
Caption is completely open-source. We've tried to make it as easy as possible to contribute. If you'd like to help out by adding features, working on bug fixes, or assisting in other parts of development, here's how to get started:

###### To begin working locally:
1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account
2. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device: `git clone git@github.com:gielcobben/caption.git`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the app by starting electron, building the code and watch for changes: `npm start`
###### To build for production (should not generally be used):
5. Build the actual app for all platforms (Mac, Windows and Linux): `npm run dist`

## üì¶ Sources
Caption currently uses 2 sources to gather subtitles. We're continuously adding sources, but the app's open-source nature also allows you to add your own when desired. This can be done in [Caption Core](https://github.com/gielcobben/caption-core).

###### Standard sources:
